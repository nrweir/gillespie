## Gillespie simulation examples, explainer, and simple implementation using Python

This article, notebook, and script is intended for Life Scientists with minimal quantitative and programming experience who want to understand (and perhaps implement) their own Gillespie simulations. Check out the .html file for a written explanation, or run the Jupyter notebook to play around (it's an interactive version of the .html file). The Python script implements a simple Gillespie simulation for a basic biological process, so you can see how it works.
